Notes from Lesson 4 Remix Fund Me:

What are we making?

We're making a crowd funding app like kickstart, or a way to raise money.
Allowing users to send EVM based coin and allow owner of the contract to withdraw funds to spend on their project.
We're gonna deploy on testnet.
A minimum funding amount will be set to $5.
