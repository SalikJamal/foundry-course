Notes from Lesson 4 Remix Fund Me:

What are we making?

We're making a crowd funding app like kickstart, or a way to raise money.
Allowing users to send EVM based coin and allow owner of the contract to withdraw funds to spend on their project.
We're gonna deploy on testnet.
A minimum funding amount will be set to $5.

To allow a smart contract to receive Ether or native cryptocurrency, we need to add the "payable" modifier in function signature.
Just like wallets, contracts can also hold coins.
You can access the value sent to the function with "msg.value" where value is the amount sent.

Use the require function to put checks in the function. If it passes it'll continue otherwise it'll revert the transaction.
