Notes from Lesson 2 Simple Storage:

Remix Intro:

Always define version on top of your contract file because it is important to know specifiy version of solidity you are using.

Write comments in code to refer and understand it later on.

To use range of solidity version for your contract define it like:

pragma soldity >= 0.8.0 < 0.9.0;

Always define SPDX License identifier so it simplies licensing code later on.

To create contract use the keyword "contract" which is very similar to classes in JavaScript.

Basic solidity data types, if not initialized they will be set to their default values.

boolean, (true/false) (default = false)
uint, (positive whole number) (default = 0)
int, (signed whole number, positive or negative) (default = 0)
address, (ethereum address) (default = 0x000000000000000)
bytes (bytes is a lower level type) (default = 0x00)


bit and bytes are units to measure computer data
bytes consist of 8 bits
bits are just 1 and 0'
big B is for bytes
small b is for bits
