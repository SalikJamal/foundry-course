Notes from Lesson 1 Blockchain Basics:

Bitcoin was made by Satoshi Nakamoto implementing the first Blockchain in 2009. Bitcoin has a set amount for scarcity.

Vitalik Buterin was the second person to implement another Blockchain called Ethereum in 2013. It was not only for transactions but to
also run smart contracts and decentralized applications.

Back in 1994 a man named Nick Szabo came up with the idea of smart contracts. Smart Contracts are a set of instruction executed in a
decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary.

Smart contracts removes centralizedforces and counterparty risk

The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is that Ethereum has smart contracts which can be used to make applications, legal documents,
agreements etc whereas in Bitcoin you can only make transactions.

An issue with smart contracts is that if we want smart contracts to replace physical agreements in our lives they would need data from the real world.
This issue is known as the "Oracle Problem". Smart contracts can't directly interact with real world data, they need oracles to do that.

Blockchain Oracles are third part service that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts.
If we want our blockchain to be fully decentralized then we can't work with a single oracle or a single source which will be running these oracles, to fix
this we would need a decentralized oracle network similar to our blockchain. Both of these networks would need to be decentralized.

Combining this on-chain decentralized logic (Smart Contracts) with off-chain decentralized data (Oracles) give rise to a new concept called 
Hybrid Smart Contracts (On-chain + off-Chain) agreements. Most of the biggest protocols we interact with today on Web3 are using 
hybrid smart contracts or interact with hybrid smart contracts.

This is what Chainlink does, it brings in decentralized data and decentralized logic together to create hybrid smart contracts, making sure
that the smart contract is decentralized end to end while giving them the feature we need. Chainlink allows for us to get data to upkeep, 
get random numbers, or customize our smart contract in meaningful ways.
