Notes from Lesson 1 Blockchain Basics:

Bitcoin was made by Satoshi Nakamoto implementing the first Blockchain in 2009. Bitcoin has a set amount for scarcity.

Vitalik Buterin was the second person to implement another Blockchain called Ethereum in 2013. It was not only for transactions but to
also run smart contracts and decentralized applications.

Back in 1994 a man named Nick Szabo came up with the idea of smart contracts. Smart Contracts are a set of instruction executed in a
decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary.
Smart contract cannot be altered (immutable), they automatically execute on the blockchain when certain conditions are met. Everyone
on the blockchain can see the terms of the contract and the execution of the contract.

Smart contracts removes centralizedforces and counterparty risk

The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is that Ethereum has smart contracts which can be used to make applications, legal documents,
agreements etc whereas in Bitcoin you can only make transactions.

An issue with smart contracts is that if we want smart contracts to replace physical agreements in our lives they would need data from the real world.
This issue is known as the "Oracle Problem". Smart contracts can't directly interact with real world data, they need oracles to do that.

Blockchain Oracles are third part service that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts.
If we want our blockchain to be fully decentralized then we can't work with a single oracle or a single source which will be running these oracles, to fix
this we would need a decentralized oracle network similar to our blockchain. Both of these networks would need to be decentralized.

Combining this on-chain decentralized logic (Smart Contracts) with off-chain decentralized data (Oracles) give rise to a new concept called 
Hybrid Smart Contracts (On-chain + off-Chain) agreements. Most of the biggest protocols we interact with today on Web3 are using 
hybrid smart contracts or interact with hybrid smart contracts.

This is what Chainlink does, it brings in decentralized data and decentralized logic together to create hybrid smart contracts, making sure
that the smart contract is decentralized end to end while giving them the feature we need. Chainlink allows for us to get data to upkeep, 
get random numbers, or customize our smart contract in meaningful ways.

Chainlink is the most popular and powerful decentralized oracle network, it is the one we're gonna be using in this course. It is also
blockchain agnostic so it'll work on any blockchain out there.

What is L2 or Layer2?

The basic concept is that blockchains can get massive with the data in it. The basic answer is that we can hook many different blockchains
into it to solve the scalibility issue. Like Ethereum is a main blockchain and (Arbitrum, Poygon, Optimism) are side chains built on top of
Ethereum. Layer2s solve this scalibility issues.

There are two types of Layer2s:

1. Optimistic Rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism

2. Zero Knowledge Rollups like zkSync and Polygon zkEVM



Term Web3:

Web1 is permissionless ope sourced web with static contents.

Web2 is the permissioned web, with dynamic content. Where companies run your agreements on their servers.

Web3 is the permissionless web with dynamic content. Where decentralized censorship resistant networks run your agreement and code. It 
generally is accompanied by the idea of user owned ecosystems, where the protocols you interact with you also own a portion of, instead
of solely being the product.


What is the value of smart contracts? What problem does it solve?

They create trust minimized agreements. They give rise to unbreakable agreements.
The purpose of smart contracts is to solve the issue of breaking promises between two parties.

When smart contracts work with oracles they can solve real world problems, create contracts that benefit the human kind taking the issue
of risk and being cheated out of the equation.

QUICK RECAP:

- Bitcoin was the first protocol to implement blockchain technology in 2009. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto.

- Ethereum was the second protocol to implement blockchain technology in 2013. It was created by Vitalik Buterin. They enabled people to make
smart contracts, decentralized trust minimized agreements. These smarts contracts can use data from real work using something decentralized oracle
networks called Chainlink. They combine decentralized logic with decentralized real world data to create hybrid smart contracts and solving
real world issues.

Benefits of Blockchain:

1- Decentralized, many node operators (software run by people) around the world run this network and make it decentralized.
2- Every node can see the data on the blockchain which enables transparency and flexibility.
3- Speed and efficiency in transactions is another benefit.
4- Security and immutablity is also another benefit, this means once data is on the blockchain it cannot be changed.
5- Hacking a blockchin is leaps and bounds more difficult than hacking a centralized database.
6- Blockchain also remove the centralized forces and counterparty risk.


What have Smart Contracts done so far?

DeFi = Decentralized Finance
DeApp = Decentralized Application
DeX = Decentralized Exchange
DAOs = Decentralized Autonoumous Organizations
NFTs = Non Fungible Tokens



What is Gas and transaction fees?

Transactions are run by a group of nodes and their incentive to run these transactions
is that they get paid a bit of native currency of the blockchain. This incentives people
to run the network. They get paid more, as the more gas the transaction uses.

What is Gas?
Gas is a unit of computational measurement, the more complex a transaction is
the more gas it will use.

To calculate how much eth is going to be used in a transaction?

Transaction fees = Gas Price * Gas used

As busy the network gets, the expensive the gas fees becomes and vice versa.


What is Hash??

A hash is a unique fixed length string, meant to identify a piece of data. They are created
by placing said data into a "hash function".

A hash algorithm or hash function is a function that computes data into a unique hash.

Ethereum uses Keccak256 for its hashing algorithm. The one we're gonna use is SHA256 Hash.

The genesis is block is the first ever block that's created in the blockchain, its hash will always be zeros.

Mining:

The process of finding a "solution" to the blockchain "problem". In this case, the "probelm" was to find a hash
that starts with four zeros. Nodes get paid for mining blocks.

A block is a list of transactions mined together, it consists of nonce, transaction and previous hash, and a timestamp.

Nonce:

A "number used once" to find the "solution" to the blockchain problem. Its also used to define the transaciton number for an
account/address.


Signing Transactions:

A private key is only knows to the key holder, its used to sign transactions on the blockchain.

Etherum and Bitcoin both use Eliliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) which is a vairant of Digital Signautre Algorithm (DSA) 

A private key is used to generate a public using the above alogrithm which can be give to anyone to make transactions with.

The private key is like a password to digitally sign transactions on the blockchain.

Mneomic phrase or secret phrase combined with account number gives different unique private keys.

The public key is derived from your private key. Anyone can see it and use it to verify that a transaction came from you.


Signing a transaction is a one way process. Someone with a private key signs a transaction by their private key being hashed with their transaction
data. Anyone can then verify this new transacion hash with your public key.

Private Key > Public Key/Address

Secret Phrase >> Private Key >> Public Key/Address


How are new private keys generated in metamask? 

They take the secret phrase and combine it with the account number which goes through an algorithm, which gives them a private key.
This private key then generates the public key.
