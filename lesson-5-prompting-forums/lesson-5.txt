Notes from Lesson 5 AI prompting & forums:

7 steps to getting out of any errors in your programming journey:

1. Tinker:
pinpoint your error, find the exact error, reason of the issue you're having. If you don't understand try pasting the error
message in google.

2. Ask your AI:
Use chatGPT, Phind, Bard to ask your AI for help, write clear and specific instructions, give as much context
as possible, use delimeters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, look out for hallucinations.
Understand the limitations of your AI, and interact with them as your having a conversation. AND ITERATE!

Hallucinations are completely wrong answers given by the AI.


3. Read the docs
Read the docs for your issue, clearly and with good focus, almost always the docs have the right answers.

4. Web search
Do a web search on google to find people having similar issues and how they solved them.

5. Ask in a forum
Use stackoverflow, ethereum stackexchange and reddit forums to ask a question about your issue. 

6. Ask on support forum or github
Ask on the support forum or github for the specific tool you are using.

7. Iterate


7 Triage steps for this course:

1. Limit self-triage to 15/20 mins.
2. Don't be afraid to ask AI, but don't skip your own self learning (Use AI scarcely, but don't be afraid to use it)
3. Use the forums if stuck anywhere.
4. Google the exact error if AI doesn't know, the forums doesn't know.
5. Post your questions in forums.
6. Posting an issue on github.

How to format a question, the right way:

1. Copy the exact error you're having, give the context
2. Put the code in code blocks
3. Pin point the issue further in your explanation
4. Also only put the code that is relevant to the issue/error.
5. Use code highlighting for your proper language. 
    eg: ```solidity|python|javascript|etc
        pragma solidty ^0.8.18;

        contract MyContract {
            function myFunction() public pure returns (string memory) {
                return "Hello, World!";
            }
        }
        ```
