Notes from Lesson 3 Storage Factory:

The ability for smart contracts to interact with each other seamlessly is knows as composibility. Smart contracts are composible beacuse they can't easily
interact with each other.

The way to define any varibles is

    Dataype visbility name;
eg: uint256 public favoriteNumber;

Solidity is case sensitive.
