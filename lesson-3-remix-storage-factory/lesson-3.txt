Notes from Lesson 3 Storage Factory:

The ability for smart contracts to interact with each other seamlessly is knows as composibility. Smart contracts are composible beacuse they can't easily
interact with each other.

The way to define any varibles is

    Dataype visbility name;
eg: uint256 public favoriteNumber;

Solidity is case sensitive.

When working with multiple files, its important to keep the versions of the file aligned together.

Normal imports vs Named imports

named imports allow you to specify which contract you want to import from the file, whereas normal ones import all of the contracts present in the file.

import { SimpleStorage } from "./SimpleStorage.sol"; // Named imports (Better version)
import "./SimpleStorage.sol"; // Normal imports 

named imports should always be the convention

To interact with a contract, you'll always need two things:

1. The contract address
2. The contract ABI (Application Binary Interface)

ABI will tell our code how it can interact with our contract.

Since we're using instances of SimpleStorage contracts we, have both the addresses and the ABIs that we can use to fire the 
store and retrieve functions in every single contract.
