Notes from Lesson 6 Foundry Simple Storage:

We're gonna be using Foundry framework because it is much faster and efficient than hardhat and truffle.

RPC URL is https endpoint that we send API calls to when sending transactions.

Infura is a node as service provider.

The chain ID is used for signing transactions. It must match the chain ID returned by the network. 
You can enter a decimal or '0x'-prefixed hexadecimal number, but we will display the number in decimal.

Use command "anvil" to start the blockchain
You can use anvil or ganache to start the blockchain, ganache will give detailed output of transactions
Use below command to deploy to local blockchain, make sure the local blockchain is running, and the contract name is correct

"forge create SimpleStorage --interactive --rpc-url ${rpcUrl} --private-key ${privateKey}"

Don't ever paste private key in vs code terminal, or even in terminal history.
To remove history, use command "history -c"
Use command "history" to see history of your commands
