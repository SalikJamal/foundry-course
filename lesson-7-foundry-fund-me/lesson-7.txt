Lesson 7 Part 1 | Foundry Fund Me

We are gonna be creating our remix-fund-me project in Foundry toolkit now.

We'll be doing professional testing, scripting and deployment using Foundry.

Lesson 7 Part 2 | Testing Introduction

You can use the following command to run the tests:

forge test

This command will run all the tests in the test file and check if they pass or fail.
In our Counter.t.sol file, what will happen is:

1. It will deploy our Counter smart contract, sets the number to 0
2. Then increments the number to 1, then checks/asserts if the number is equal to 1
